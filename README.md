## Installation

Run `npm i factoid`.

`import factoid from 'factoid';`

`factoid.showRandomFact();` inside task where you'd like to see a fun random fact.

## Reasoning

Considering fact that sometimes tasks take a while to run, staring at a console becomes very boring. I built **factoid** in hopes of filling that boredom gap. Hopefully it works for some.
